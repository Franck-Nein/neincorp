# Usage
Visit [mapartcraft](https://rebane2001.com/mapartcraft) on [rebane2001.com](https://rebane2001.com) or use a mirror on [web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rebane2001.com/mapartcraft)  
Since all the processing occurs client-side, it is possible to host your own instance with a very simple HTTP server, like python3's http.server  
However, it is recommended to use the [rebane2001.com](https://rebane2001.com/mapartcraft) site as it is always up to date with new features and bugfixes
